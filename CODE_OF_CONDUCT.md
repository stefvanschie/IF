## Goal

We (the community) highly encourage others to give feedback on the project, share opinions, have discussions and help improve the project.
To make this an enjoyable experience for everyone there needs to be a set of rules that are enforced to create a healthy workspace, where we
can all enjoy our time. The rules and standards apply to everyone who contributes to this project (issues, pull requests, etc.) regardless
of age, ethnicity, religion, role/status, gender identity/expression, nationality, preferences, race, sexual identity/orientation,
experience, size or personal appearance.

## Rules and Standards

* Be welcoming to new users and help them learn about this project if needed
* Keep conversations on topic: if you think your reply isn't on topic, please refrain from posting and instead create a new issue/pull request
* Use swearing in moderation and don't target swear words at other users
* All users are equal regardless of age, ethnicity, religion, role/status, gender identity/expression, nationality, preferences, race, sexual identity/orientation, experience, size or personal appearance.
* Don't harass others based on their English skills. Correcting them is allowed and encouraged, but should be done in a civil manner
* All posts should be made in English, or at the very least an English translation should be provided.
* Do not spread hate towards other (similar) projects/communities
* Remind others of the rules and standards when needed
* Don't publish others private information (such as passwords, addresses, etc.) without explicit permission

## Enforcement

(Continuous) cases of users breaking the rules or not following the standards should be reported to the author of the project or
any maintainers. You can get in contact by sending a private message on either DevBukkit (stefvanschie) or SpigotMC (Stef), or if
preferred by mailing to stefvanschiedev@gmail.com. You can also report to these accounts when the author or any maintainer is breaking the
rules/standards.

## Responsibility

The author and maintainers try to enforce an enjoyable and healthy workspace for every user. They have the final say and can remove and edit
any contributions. If you think the actions that were taken are incorrect, you may report this behaviour by contacting anyone as described in the
enforcement section.
